GraphQL queries give clients great flexibility in the way they request data from the server, preventing issues such overfetching or underfetching of data, and allowing multiple resources to be retrieved in a single request. In this course you'll learn how to use GraphQL both on the server side and in client applications through practical examples in the form of full-stack JavaScript applications. You will be introduced to all the main GraphQL concepts like schema definition, Queries Mutations, and Subscriptions, as well as to solution to common requirements such as handling authentication/authorization and client-side caching."
